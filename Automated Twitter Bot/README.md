# Internet Speed Twitter Bot

This project is a Python script that automatically measures your internet speed and posts the results on Twitter. It uses the Selenium library to automate browser actions.

## Installation
To use this script, you will need to install a few dependencies. You can install them using pip:

You will also need the Chrome browser driver that matches your browser version.
You can download ChromeDriver from [the ChromeDriver website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

## Usage

2. Run the `InternetSpeedTwitterBot.py` script.
3. The script will automatically measure your internet speed and post the results to your Twitter account.

## Notes
- This script uses [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/ru) to measure internet speed.
- Please note that if you want to post tweets automatically, you will need Twitter API keys and access tokens.
