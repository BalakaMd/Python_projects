# Pomodoro Timer

## Description

This is a Pomodoro Timer application that helps you manage your work and breaks effectively.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application provides a visual timer and
tracks your work and break intervals.

## Features

- Set customizable work and break durations.
- Start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Visual display of the timer using a tomato image.
- Keep track of completed work and break intervals.
- Cross-platform compatibility (requires Python and Tkinter).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com//BalakaMd/Python_projects/pomodoro.git
```

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You can start the timer by clicking the "Start" button, and reset it using the "Reset" button.

## Usage

- Click "Start" to begin a work or break session.
- The timer will count down and display the time remaining in minutes and seconds.
- After the session is completed, the timer will automatically switch to the next session (work or break).
- You can track completed sessions with checkmarks displayed on the screen.

## Customize

You can customize the timer settings in the `main.py` file. The following constants can be adjusted to your preferences:

- `WORK_MIN`: Work session duration in minutes (default is 25 minutes).
- `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`: Short break duration in minutes (default is 5 minutes).
- `LONG_BREAK_MIN`: Long break duration in minutes (default is 20 minutes).
