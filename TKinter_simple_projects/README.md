# Timezone Check

This is a simple Python application that allows you to check the current time in a different country based
on its two-letter country code. It uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user
interface and `pytz` for timezone information.

## Features

- Input a two-letter country code to check the current time in that country.
- Provides a list of example country codes and their corresponding timezones.
- Error handling for incorrect or invalid country codes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:
```

```bash
pip install pytz
```

## Usage

1. Run the application by executing the `timeznes.py` script.
2. Input a two-letter country code and click the "Go!" button.
3. The current time in the specified country will be displayed on the interface.


## Exit the Application
